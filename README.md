## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column

## My process

To ensure responsiveness on various devices, I initially organized the designs in the Figma files using a mobile-first strategy.

I then made the header and sidebar components, adding functionality to each to make sure it functioned as it should.

I then developed the main field, which would house the board and each board's tasks.

I developed Form UI components for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks to simplify task management.

Once all the parts were in place, I modified the task functions to fit each layout and added functionality to them.

Finally, I extensively tested the project, making sure that each function was operational and evaluating it in various scenarios.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ReactContext-API
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- ContextAPI - State Management
- DnD kit - Drag and Drop [Column & Tasks]
- TypeScript - Type cheking to catch potential errors on compile-time
- LocalStorage - persist data when refreshing the page

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my skills in working with React-controlled forms, which were essential for updating, removing, and adding new data to JSON files.

The only problem i had to deal with is the deep nested objects and arrays , heres a snippet to update nested array in nested object , i dont know if this is best practice dealing with nested object , but it works ðŸ¤·

### Continued development

for next projects :
